            Hello, my name is Praymore Tettey Omeni. I am from Ghana and I enjoy serving the Lord. I enjoy playing
            soccer. I am currently studying Web Design and Development
            at BYU. I am excited to learn more about web development and design. I am looking
            forward to creating my own website and learning more about the industry. I am excited
            to see what the future holds for me.
